## Configuration
Before running the main.py script, you need to set up your config.json file with the path to your data. First create a config.json file based on config.sample.json template with the correct datapath: 
```json
{
    "data_path": "path/to/your/data.csv"
}
```
Replace "path/to/your/data.csv" with the actual path to the CSV file containing your dataset.

After setting up your config.json file, you can run the main.py script from the src directory. Navigate to the src directory and run:
```bash
python main.py
```
